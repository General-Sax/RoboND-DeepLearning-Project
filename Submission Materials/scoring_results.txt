# First Train

Scores for while the quad is following behind the target:
number of validation samples intersection over the union evaluated on 542
average intersection over union for background is 0.9955025222097581
average intersection over union for other people is 0.35207941638414414
average intersection over union for the hero is 0.8674404636204325
number true positives: 539, number false positives: 0, number false negatives: 0

Scores for while the quad is on patrol and the target is not visible:
number of validation samples intersection over the union evaluated on 270
average intersection over union for background is 0.9865284098816506
average intersection over union for other people is 0.7243768584016291
average intersection over union for the hero is 0.0
number true positives: 0, number false positives: 15, number false negatives: 0

This score measures how well the neural network can detect the target from far away:
